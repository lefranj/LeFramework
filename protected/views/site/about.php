<p class="lead text-primary">Hi!</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    I'm LeFranj - creator of LeFramework. This framework was created just because I was bored. But, it can be used
    as a simple, lightweight website framework.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    <span class="text-primary">Have fun!</span>
</p>
<p class="text-muted">
    P.S. I will update it from time to time... Maybe...
